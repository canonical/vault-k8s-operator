Vault is a tool for securely managing secrets used in modern computing (e.g. passwords, certificates, API keys).

The Vault Operators deploy and initialize Vault on Kubernetes and Machine models. They run in high availability mode using the Raft backend.

For more information, including guides, integrations, and configuration options, read the [Vault Charms documentation](https://canonical-vault-charms.readthedocs-hosted.com).
