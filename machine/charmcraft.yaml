summary: A tool for managing secrets
description: |
  Vault secures, stores, and tightly controls access to
  tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other
  secrets in modern computing. Vault handles leasing, key
  revocation, key rolling, and auditing. Through a unified
  API, users can access an encrypted Key/Value store and
  network encryption-as-a-service, or generate AWS IAM/STS
  credentials, SQL/NoSQL databases, X.509 certificates,
  SSH credentials, and more.

      description: Specifies the maximum possible lease duration for Vault's tokens and secrets.
    common_name:
      type: string
      description: |
        The common name that will be used by Vault as an intermediate CA. This will only be used when the charm is 
        configured to use a Vault PKI backend through the `vault-pki` relation.
        The charm will only issue certificates for the subdomains under the `common_name` specified.
    log_level:
      type: string
      default: "info"
      description: >-
        The log verbosity level. Supported values (in order of descending detail) are trace, debug, info, warn, and error.

actions:
  authorize-charm:
    description: >-
      Authorizes the charm to be able to interact with Vault to manage its
      operations. A token is required for Vault to use to create the app role and
      the policy the charm will use to interact with Vault. This token must be
      placed in juju secret, and this secret should be granted to the charm.
    params:
      secret-id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A secret id from juju that contains a token for Vault that can create 
          new policies, such as the root token that is provided upon initializing 
          Vault. Used to create the app role and policy for the charm. It is not
          stored by the charm.
    required: [secret-id]

  bootstrap-raft:
    description: >-
      Bootstraps raft using a peers.json file. This action requires the
      application to first be scaled to a single unit.  Bootstrapping can help
      recover when quorum is lost, however, it may cause uncommitted Raft log
      entries to be committed. See
      https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage#manual-recovery-using-peers-json
      for more details.

  create-backup:
    description: >-
      Creates a snapshot of the Raft backend and saves it to the S3 storage.
      Returns backup ID.
    params:
      skip-verify:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          Whether to skip the verification of the S3 connection TLS certificate.
          If set to "true", the charm will not verify the S3 connection.

  list-backups:
    description: >-
      Lists all available backups.
    params:
      skip-verify:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          Whether to skip the verification of the S3 connection TLS certificate.
          If set to "true", the charm will not verify the S3 connection.

  restore-backup:
    description: >-
      Restores a backup from the S3 storage to the Raft backend.
      Returns backup ID.
    params:
      backup-id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Backup ID to restore.
      skip-verify:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          Whether to skip the verification of the S3 connection TLS certificate.
